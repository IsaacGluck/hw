s1,s2,s3,s4,s5,s6
Won't run because values aren't 
assigned to int String or anything else.
Need to run: String s1,s2,s3,s4,s5,s6

String Values

s1=new String("Hello");
s2="Hello";
s3=s1;
s4="Hello";
s5="World";
s6=new String("World");

Outputs

s1==s2: False
s1==s3: True
s1==s4: False
s1==s5: False
s1==s6: False
s2==s3: False
s2==s4: False
(^^ expected False but
turned out true because
they were both assigned
the same value without
creating new memory 
locations. Thus because
they share the same 
memory location, they
are interpreted as ==
being true in this case.)

s2==s5: False
s2==s6: False
s3==s4: False
s3==s5: False
s3==s6: False
s4==s5: False
s4==s6: False
s5==s6: False
