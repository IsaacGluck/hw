# Homework

---

### Workflow:

Please be sure to upload your homework into the correct repository.

1. `cd` into the repository.
2. `git pull`.
3. work on files, if you add new ones, `git add` them. if you need to delete them, `git rm` them.
4. periodically `git commit -a -m “message”` to store your changes locally.
5. `git push` when you want to send the changes to the server.

### Additional Notes:

Please *do not* delete everyone's folder.

Before you commit, do `git status` to see the changes you made locally.
