# Homework

---

### Workflow:

Please be sure to upload your homework into the correct repository.

1. `cd` into the homework repository.
2. `git pull`.
3. Work on files, if you add new ones, `git add` them. if you need to delete them, `git rm` them.
4. Periodically `git pull` to make sure you're up to date prior to commiting. This will ensure that vim won't pop up on you to merge.
4. `git commit -a -m “message”` to store your changes locally.
5. `git push` to send those changes to the server.

### Additional Notes:

Please *do not* delete everyone's folder.

Before you commit, do `git status` to see the changes you made locally.
